### 🔭 Current Project: **Student Database Application**

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>You are a Database Administrator for a university and need to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.</p> 

This application will:
- Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- A student can enroll in the following courses:
History 101
Mathematics 101
English 101
Chemistry 101
Computer Science 101
- Each course costs $600 to enroll
- The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
